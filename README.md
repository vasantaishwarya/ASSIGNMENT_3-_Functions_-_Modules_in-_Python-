Program Descriptions

Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function 

Functionality:

1. Iterative Method: Defines a function named `factorial_loop` that calculates the factorial of a number using a loop.
2. Recursive Method: Defines a function named `factorial_recursive` that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.
3. User Input: Prompts the user to enter a number.
4. Calculations: Computes the factorial using both methods.
5. Output: Displays the results of both calculations.

Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations (task2_math_operations.py)

Functionality:

1. User Input: Prompts the user to enter a number.

2. Calculations: Uses Python's math module to compute:

  Square root of the number
  Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
  Sine of the number (in radians)

3. Output: Displays the calculated results.
